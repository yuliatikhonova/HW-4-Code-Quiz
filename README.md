For this project we were asked to make a code quiz that is a typical combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenge. We were to build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions.
We were asked to when the start button is clicked the timer and first question pops up. For example:

We also had to make sure that a new question is presented when an answer is clicked. For example:

![When answer is clicked](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62128411/80317331-08d30200-87b8-11ea-8061-44b15c43f043.gif)

If the incorrect answer is chosen, then we were suppose to subtract time from the timer. For example:

Then when all the questions are answered or the timer hits 0, the game needs to end. For example:

When the game is over we can input our initials and put them on the high score board:
